	npiv a Linux Fiber Channel NPIV configuration tool


npiv is a systemd configuration service and command line interface for
configuring Fiber Channel NPIV connections.  

The systemd service acts on a configuration file to create and destroy NPIV
connections at service startup and shutdown.

The npiv command line utility allows the insertion and deletion of entries
into the configuration file used by the systemd service.  It also allows for
the immediate activation and deactivation of NPIV interfaces.
